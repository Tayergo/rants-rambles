# BACKSTORY:
Connor Talon's  parents died in a car crash when C.T was very young. A drunk driver had swerved into the car at a high enough speed as to where a freak accident occurred, where Connor's mother had been instantly impaled (and killed) by the road railing that had gone through the front car window, and Connor's dad had severe injuries from the impact, and later died. Connor themselves thankfully barely avoided serious injury.

C.T was left abandoned as a result of the car crash, their father having died 24 hours after the accident. This left a permanent mental scar on C.T, as well as the fact they had to fend for themselves.

They never really had too many friends at school, and they basically lived at a library, since they didn't really have a home. They were bad at making friends, and they seemed to just be ignored at school..

They used the computers at the library ALOT, making many online friends, who were their only friends. Connor also found out about true crime through the internet this way, marking the path Connor went down, for them to become a detective.

They became a detective, and was doing cases pretty well. They got into conspiracy theories, not the crazy stuff however, they only got into the logical ones. They started a YouTube channel on conspiracy theories and true crime, which became a secondary income source.

Connor also began to realize they were autistic at this time. They noticed their general social difficulty, their intense interest in conspiracy theories and true crime, and also their sensitivities to sounds and lights, and realized they had gone undiagnosed. They chose to not get a formal diagnosis as not to change how others viewed them, however.

Connor one day got the ONE case, and was sent to San Francisco. They had uploaded a video on the case as they had traveled to San Francisco. Then, they arrived in San Francisco.

# PERSONALITY:
A pretty laid-back person. They are quite a dedicated detective , getting quite fixated/obsessed with some cases, always looking for clues, looking for ANYONE who may have more info. They tend to get attached easily to those who show care towards them, eventually (and unavoidably) gaining romantic feelings for said person.

They like and prefer to stay to themselves and not talk to people, but they often force themselves to actively be social. They want to be better at social situations, and they figure that the only way to get better, is practice.

They are quite smart academically/intellectually, something that naturally comes with the ability to access all the information in the world, via the Internet, at all times, due to their nature of being a tablet. They describe themselves as "a social idiot" however.

They are quite soft and loving towards the people they care about, but at the same time, they can be quite cold and uncaring towards other people, in some cases (mostly when they're interrogating a suspect) they can get outright violent, and has severely harmed a few people due to this. They always feel a high level of dread and regret about it later.
